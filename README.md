Steps:
1.Run Lenet file first to load your architecture.
2. Run Train file to train your model using the dataset given.
3. Check by running test file if your model is giving correct accuracy.
4. Deploy the model file created to raspberry pi and run the  NotHotDogModel on Raspberry pi to check model accuracy in run time.

Versions Used(On laptop as well as Raspberry Pi):
Tensoflow 1.1.0 
Keras 2.1.5
